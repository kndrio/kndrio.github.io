  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Thanks <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, this looks pretty good to me start writing!</p>

<p>Like many others Im late to start this shit. But’s ok shit happens and is better late than never. At least now I write one and I can hard try to not go out early.</p>

<p>Blablabla…</p>

<p><b>why im here?</b></p>

<p>Just being part, creating and contributing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A human being is a part of the whole called by us universe, a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feeling as something separated from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.”
― Albert Einstein</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>whoami</b></p>

<p><a href="http://about.me/kndrio">kndrio</a> is one of me but <a href="http://br.linkedin.com/in/kennedycarvalho/">Carvalho, Kennedy</a> if you prefer sir.. 
<!--
/**
* @ToWrite #personal 
* Hey tell yours readers who you are.
*/
Focus that post is not for that!
I pause coding here to see the changes. :)
--></p>

<p><b>Why you’re doing that?</b> <s> 3rd if you prefer, customers always right when are right</s>
<!--1rd again, catch me if you can!--></p>

<p>I really considerate this as an terapia or hobby or just self promoting…
The first reason is that I need write things that I dont talk or dont talk enough and even things that I talk all the time and must “log” that on one place, like man did in caves on the past.</p>

</center>
<p><br />
But if it’s important, and it is and thats why I’m writing it here, is that I read one post <s>and many others before but that was really exciting and will gain the credits</s> that makes me take this decision. Thats was the post, <a href="https://medium.com/better-humans/better-than-meditation-12532d29f6cd">Better than meditation.</a> I really don’t remember how I follows this link and now when I googled for it I found another good too. You can try be <s>convinced</s> motivated in this one if the first didn’t work. <a href="https://medium.com/@wynlim/the-power-of-your-writing-c235ee82e603">The power of writing.</a> Im not a meditation practitioner and to say the truth I believe that the power of talk is higher than write…</p>

<p>To keep it simple, that post who one stranger write idk why, where or for what, really help me to wake. Now i’m here doing pages follows pages trying to do the ball rolling. Maybe some day being important for one person even just me!</p>

<!--
E pra falar a verdade eu me obriguei a fazer isso nas minhas férias xD

<p>At least im learning new things and improving my skills… </p>

<p>Yeah my dear reader thats not only words. xD</p>

<p>And maybe this is why I prefer write in english than portuguese if you would like to know.</p>

<p>Now the first post, better saying, second is born. Let me sleep cause is very late and I got to wake early tomorrow. I have no time to meditation! </p>
